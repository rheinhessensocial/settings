List of instances blocked by rheinhessen.social
=======

This is a list of Mastodon/GNU Social instances blocked by [rheinhessen.social](https://rheinhessen.social) (based on the list of instances blocked by chaos.social). If you think an
instance has been unfairly blocked, please contact the administrators [@moderation](https://rheinhessen.social/@moderation).

The purpose of this list is to be transparent towards our users, and to collaborate with other admins on identifying
those instances that violate the Code of Conduct, or those that tend to contain bad actors, and who boost unwanted
content into other instances. Instances that don't exist anymore are removed periodically.

Notes about when we block an instance
-------

Every instance blocked before 2022-11-11 was blocked based on the list of instances blockes by chaos.social. We checked some of the instances (but not all of them), and decided to trust this list.

Since 2022-11-11 we check every instance before blocking in the following way (we still use new entries of the chaos.social-blocklist, but also other sources):

1. Does the instance have a public timeline or profile list, so we can see some content posted on this instance?

No? -> Continue with Step 4

Yes -> Continue with Step 2

2. Is there any sign, that the instance has even a few basic rules (e.g.: it is not allowed to harass people, it is not allowed to publish NS-Propaganda, unconsensual pictures, illegal content, ...)?

No? -> We have to assume, that there is a good reason to block this instance

Yes -> Continue with Step 3

3. Do we find problematic content by reading for 1 or 2 minutes of the public timeline (or looking at some profiles in the profile list)?

No? -> We do not block this instance

Yes -> Welcome to the blocklist

4. From where comes the information, that it could be useful to block this instance?

new entry of the list of blocked instances of chaos.social -> We do trust them to have a good reason to block this instance, since we can not check this ourselves we also block this.

one report by one of our users -> maybe blocking the account on the other instance, but not the complete instance.

multiple reports by our users -> Welcome to the blocklist

trusted/known account -> Welcome to the blocklist

untrusted account -> ignoring

### Footnotes

¹ Silenced 🔇 vs suspended ⛔: Silenced instances don't appear in the Federated timeline, but their accounts can still
be seen, e.g. by searching for them, by interacting with them in conversations, or by following them.

² "Free speech zone": A place where it's okay to promote e.g. National Socialism because the argument is that open
discussion is more important than people's sensitivities or the denazification laws of Germany/France/etc.

³ "lolicon": sexualized depictions of children
